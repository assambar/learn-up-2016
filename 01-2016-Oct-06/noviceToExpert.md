# The Dreyfus model of skill acquisition.

## What is the Dreyfus model anyway?

-   a proposed model in the fields of education and operational research of how
    students/apprentices acquire skills through formal instruction and practice
    in the context of their education.
-   proposed by the Stuart and Hubert Dreyfus brothers in 1980 in a paper
    summarizing their research on the topic in UC Berkeley.
-   the stages of expertise, according to the model, are chiefly five:
    1.  Novice.
    2.  Competent.
    3.  Proficient.
    4.  Expert.
    5.  Master.
-   the model is based on 4 binary qualities.
    -   Recollection.
    -   Recognition.
    -   Decision.
    -   Awareness.

## The Individual Stages of the Original Model.

### Novice.

A novice follows precise rules exactly, without questioning them, without
context or specific responsibilities beyond rigidly adhering to the rules
and plans they are taught. At later stages of competence, one acquires
**organizational skills** and is able to quickly access the rules particular
to the task at hand. In other words, active decision making characterizes
later levels of expertise. Further down the path, one develops **intuition**,
which guides their decisions and helps them formulate their own
plans/strategies. Thus one progresses from **rigid adherence** to an intuitive
mode of reasoning based on tacit knowledge.


-   rigid adherence to rules.
-   no discretionary judgment.

### Advanced Beginner.

-   one has a somewhat limited situational perception.
-   all aspects of the work are observed separately and given equal
    importance.

### Competent.

-   one is capable of deliberate planning.
-   one is capable of formulating precise routines.

### Proficient.

-   one can  possess a holistic view of a given situation.
-   one is able to work with priorities.
-   one employs maxims for guidance, adapting their meanings to the particular
    situation at hand.

### Expert.

At this stage one finally transcends reliance on rules, guidelines, maxims,
and is able to easily acquire a intuitive gasp of the situation based on
their own deep, tacit understanding, and employs analytical approaches when
necessary.

## The actual **updated** Dreyfus Model.

### Novice, with the following qualities.

-   analytical decision.
-   decomposed recognition.
-   monitoring awareness.
-   non-situational recollection

### Competence, with the following qualities.

-   analytical decision.
-   decomposed recognition.
-   monitoring awareness.
-   situational recollection.

### Proficiency, with the following qualities.

-   analytical decision.
-   holistic recognition.
-   monitoring awareness.
-   situational recollection.

### Expertise, with the following qualities.

-   holistic recognition.
-   intuitive decision.
-   monitoring awareness.
-   situational recollection.

### Mastery, with the following qualities.

-   absorbed awareness.
-   holistic recognition.
-   intuitive decision.
-   situational recollection.

## Criticism of the Model.

the model has been criticized because of the lack of empirical evidence for
the presence of distinct stages in the process of developing expertise in
some field. Furthermore while the model argues that experts employ no
analytical thinking and instead exclusively rely on intuition, this might not
be true.
